\section{DM16: Reduce LDF service level}\label{sect:dm16}

NCSA has been  asked to do an impact analysis of a reduction in budget by 20\%.
This can only be achieved by reducing the staffing level from 20 FTE to 16.
This may result in a lower service level for DM development it probably has no impact on science except in the realm of reliability but we need the analysis from NCSA.
%Note that we continue to find it difficult to track effort and deliverables from NCSA; this urgently needs to improve.

Adopting a ``cloud computing'' based approach may yield further savings.
We are currently prototyping cloud-based deployments of DM systems in conjunction with Google.
Assessing the actual cost of this relative to physical hardware at NCSA is difficult; see \citeds{DMTN-072} for a rough comparison.

A 20\% reduction in NCSA costs for the remaining four years of construction is worth about \$3.5M.
