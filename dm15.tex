\section{DM15: Reduce institutional overheads}\label{sect:dm15}

If we could identify perhaps ten individuals who would move to AURA posts, thus eliminating institutional overheads,
we could save potentially \$100k per individual or \$1M per year.
It will take months to put this in place of course so we would not get three years of savings.
The institutes may complain but we expect this to be minimal.
This is a scientifically and functionally painless way to trim the budget, but may cause some disruption for the individuals concerned in the short term.

Potential saving of \$2M  or more to end of construction.
